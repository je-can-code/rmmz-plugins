 * [v1.0.0 SKS] A plugin enabling actors to equip skills into dedicated skill slots.

 * ============================================================================
 * OVERVIEW
 * This plugin enables actors to equip skills into dedicated skill slots using
 * a point-budget system. Each actor has a pool of slot points; skills cost
 * points to equip, and only skills of the configured equippable types appear
 * in the equip scene.
 *
 * Integrates with others of mine plugins:
 * - J-Base; required by all my plugins.
 * - J-Passive; equipping a passive skill activates its perpetual state effect.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DETAILS
 * Each actor has a maximum number of slot points (maxSlotPoints). Skills that
 * belong to the configured equippable skill types can be placed into slots,
 * each consuming a number of slot points equal to their slot cost. The player
 * manages equipped skills through the SKS equip scene, accessible from the
 * menu when the configured menu switch is ON.
 *
 * Skills tagged as "unslotted" are perpetually active and never appear in the
 * equip scene. Skills whose type is not in the equippable list are also treated
 * as implicitly unslotted, meaning they remain freely available to whatever
 * other system manages them (such as JABS combat slot equipping).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SLOT COST
 * Want to control how many slot points a skill consumes? By applying the
 * appropriate tag to skills in the database, you can fine-tune the cost of
 * equipping each skill.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Skills
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <slotCost:AMOUNT>
 *    Where AMOUNT is the number of slot points this skill costs to equip.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <slotCost:2>
 * This skill costs 2 slot points to equip into a slot.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * UNSLOTTED
 * Want a skill to always be active without occupying a slot? By applying the
 * appropriate tag to skills in the database, you can mark them as perpetually
 * active. These skills will not appear in the equip scene.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Skills
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <unslotted>
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <unslotted>
 * This skill is always active and will never appear in the SKS equip scene.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SLOT COST MODIFIER
 * Want to adjust the slot cost of skills based on what an actor has equipped
 * or what states they are under? By applying the appropriate tag across the
 * various database locations, you can modify the effective slot cost of skills
 * for that actor.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Weapons
 * - Armor
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <slotCostModifier:AMOUNT>
 *    Where AMOUNT is the flat modifier applied to all skill slot costs.
 *    Negative values reduce the cost; positive values increase it.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <slotCostModifier:-1>
 * All skills cost 1 fewer slot point while this is active on the actor.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * CHANGELOG:
 * - 1.0.0
 *    The initial release.
